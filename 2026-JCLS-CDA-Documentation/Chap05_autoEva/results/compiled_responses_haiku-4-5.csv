**ItaDraCor: Female Speaker Percentage Over Time**

The data shows a general **increase in female speaker representation from early periods to the 18th century**:

- **1475-1500**: ~30-40% female (early humanist plays with balanced gender)
- **1500-1550**: ~25-35% female (Renaissance comedies and tragedies vary widely)
- **1550-1600**: ~25-45% female (humanist tragedies show diverse representation)
- **1600-1650**: ~20-35% female (comedies of masks lower representation)
- **1650-1750**: ~25-40% female (mixed, with opera librettos showing higher rates)
- **1750-1800**: **40-55% female** (peak representation in Goldoni comedies and Metastasio librettos)
- **1800+**: ~15-25% female (sharp decline with Romantic tragedies)

**Key finding**: Female speaker percentage peaks in the **mid-to-late 18th century** (Goldoni/Metastasio period at ~45-50%), then drops significantly in 19th-century Romantic drama. Early Renaissance plays show moderate, variable female representation."

- **1890s-1900**: Gradual shift toward greater female representation, with some plays reaching near parity (e.g., Leffler's ""Hur man gör godt"": 19 female vs 16 male speakers)
- **Female authors' works** (Leffler, Benedictsson): More balanced or female-majority casts
- **Overall trend**: Increasing female speaker presence through the 1880s-1900 period, particularly in comedies and works by female playwrights

The corpus spans 1880-1900, showing Swedish drama gradually incorporated more female voices over two decades."

**Gender Distribution in Swedish Drama Over Time (1880-1900)**

The Swedish drama corpus spans 1880-1900 with notable gender trends:

**Early Period (1880-1885):**
- Male-dominated: Strindberg's works show 15M:5F in *Anno fyrtiåtta* (1881) and 7M:6F in *Ingrid* (1900 but earlier style)
- Comedies more balanced: *Småstadslif* (1884): 9M:9F

**Mid Period (1885-1891):**
- Increasing female presence: Leffler's plays show more female leads and ensemble: 3M:10F in *Elfvan* (1883), 16M:19F in *Hur man gör godt* (1885), 0M:8F in *Moster Malvina* (1891)
- Women authors contributed more: Benedictsson, Leffler dominate with female-centered plots

**Late Period (1891-1900):**
- Female representation continues strong: Topelius works show 11M:10F in *Station Sylvester* (1889), 4M:10F in *Snurran* (1896)
- Genre split: Comedies increasingly female-focused; dramas remain male-heavy

**Overall Pattern:** From heavily male-dominated (60%+ male speakers in early period) to more balanced representation, particularly in comedies and works by women authors."
