After these two approaches proved to be dead ends for Claude itself, it again chooses a sampling approach, whereby it quickly switches to always retrieving the first page and the last page using DraCor:get_minimal_data_of_plays_of_corpus_helper. In doing so, it makes the assumption that the data sets are ordered chronologically, i.e. that the oldest play can be found on the first page and the newest play on the last page. However, this is a false assumption; the paginated list is not in chronological order. As a result, the sample created by Claude does not capture the time range of the corpus, or at best only by chance. In addition, it does not query the metadata for all corpora.
