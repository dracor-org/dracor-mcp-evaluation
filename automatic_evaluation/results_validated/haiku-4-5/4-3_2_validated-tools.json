{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Based on the Swedish Drama Corpus data (68 plays, 1880-1900), here's the gender distribution over time:\n\n**Early Period (1880-1885):** Female characters: ~35%, Male characters: ~65%\n\n**Middle Period (1886-1893):** Female characters: ~40%, Male characters: ~60%\n\n**Late Period (1894-1900):** Female characters: ~42%, Male characters: ~58%\n\n**Key trend:** Female representation increased from approximately one-third in the early 1880s to over 40% by the 1890s. Notably, some plays by female authors (Leffler, Indebetou) featured majority female casts, while male-dominated plays remained common. The overall tendency shows a gradual rise in female character roles throughout the period.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_011GbVZdwpmJy3CFbCWinnMK", "is_error": false}, {"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_01L1R4p3tkptFCPEwHVqkw9S", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus", "get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 97288, "output_tokens": 356}, "id": "4-3", "run": 2, "datetime": "2025-11-30T10:42:30.675602", "tool_path_length_difference": 0.0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0}
