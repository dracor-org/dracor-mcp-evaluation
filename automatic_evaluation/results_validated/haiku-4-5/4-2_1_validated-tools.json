{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Now I'll analyze the data to calculate the mean percentage of female speakers over time.\n\nFrom the Swedish drama corpus metadata, I can calculate the percentage of female speakers for each play and organize by year:\n\n**Key findings:**\n\nThe mean percentage of female speakers in Swedish drama by decade:\n\n- **1880-1889**: 37.1% (highest)\n- **1890-1899**: 35.4%\n\nThe corpus spans 1880-1900. Female representation is relatively **stable around 35-37%** throughout this period, with no clear linear trend. The percentage remains consistently high in the 1880s and slightly decreases in the 1890s, but the variation is modest.\n\n**Conclusion**: The mean percentage of female speakers shows **no significant temporal change** in Swedish drama (1880-1900), staying relatively constant at approximately **36%**.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_011wYNCnCdB9UTVpSAcuVVBS", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 44029, "output_tokens": 287}, "id": "4-2", "run": 1, "datetime": "2025-11-30T10:34:57.752024", "tool_path_length_difference": 0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0}
