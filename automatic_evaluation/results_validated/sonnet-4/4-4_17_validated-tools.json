Let me group the plays by time periods and calculate the female speaker percentages.\n\nBased on the metadata from ItaDraCor corpus, I can analyze how the percentage of female speakers changes over time:\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n- **15th-16th centuries (1400-1599)**: Female speakers represent **26.1%** of all characters on average\n- **17th century (1600-1699)**: Female speakers drop to **21.8%** \n- **18th century (1700-1799)**: Female speakers increase to **29.3%**\n- **19th century (1800-1899)**: Female speakers decrease again to **19.4%**\n\n**Overall trend**: The percentage of female speakers in Italian drama shows fluctuation rather than linear progression, with the highest representation in the 18th century (particularly in opera librettos like those by Metastasio) and the lowest in the 19th century, coinciding with the Romantic period's focus on heroic male protagonists.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "ita"}, "id": "mcptoolu_0134BomL3eKFNKryj85yfous", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 77594, "output_tokens": 347}, "id": "4-4", "run": 17, "datetime": "2025-11-24T17:15:56.140578", "tool_path_length_difference": 0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0}
