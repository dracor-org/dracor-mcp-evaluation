The most dramatic increase occurs from the late 18th century onwards, with the 20th century showing the highest percentages of female speakers.\n\nThe data reveals a consistent historical progression toward greater gender balance in German dramatic literature.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata_csv", "input": {"corpus_name": "ger"}, "id": "mcptoolu_015epSP46CX4sARSaSFwBHBZ", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata_csv"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 150004, "output_tokens": 339}, "id": "4-1", "run": 20, "datetime": "2025-11-24T17:37:07.916013", "tool_path_length_difference": 0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0}
