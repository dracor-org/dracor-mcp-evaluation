The corpus shows Swedish drama became more female-inclusive in the 1890s before returning to more balanced gender representation by century's end.\n\n*Note: Limited sample size (69 plays) and author concentration (especially Strindberg and Leffler) may influence these patterns.*", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_01AhYZ7yzYWzQDuGexBaYggv", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 43657, "output_tokens": 562}, "id": "4-2", "run": 11, "datetime": "2025-11-24T16:30:42.297348", "tool_path_length_difference": 0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0}
