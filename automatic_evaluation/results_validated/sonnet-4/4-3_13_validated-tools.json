{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Based on the Swedish drama corpus data, here's the concise analysis of gender distribution changes over time:\n\n**Gender Distribution in Swedish Drama Changes Over Time:**\n\n**Early Period (1880-1890):** Male-dominated with approximately 60-70% male characters. Female representation averages 30-40%.\n\n**Mid Period (1890-1900):** Gradual shift toward more balanced representation. Female characters increase to 40-45%, male characters decrease to 55-60%.\n\n**Later Period (1897-1900):** Notable improvement in female representation, reaching near-parity in some works (45-50% female). Some plays by authors like Leffler achieve majority female casts.\n\n**Key Pattern:** Steady increase in female character representation from ~30% (1880s) to ~45% (1890s), with the most progressive works appearing in the 1890s. Authors like Anne Charlotte Leffler consistently featured more balanced or female-majority casts.\n\n**Notable:** Strindberg's works remain male-dominated throughout, while female authors and some male contemporaries drove the progressive trend toward gender balance.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_015871oum8vWFHzF8mwq21vg", "is_error": false}, {"name": "get_corpus_metadata_csv", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_01NbD37LJEifcx9UoxodrTNC", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata", "get_corpus_metadata_csv"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 86084, "output_tokens": 419}, "id": "4-3", "run": 13, "datetime": "2025-11-24T16:45:27.525071", "tool_path_length_difference": 0.0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0}
