{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Now I'll analyze the data to calculate female speaker percentages by time periods and examine the trend.\n\nBased on the Italian corpus metadata, I can calculate the percentage of female speakers for each play and analyze the temporal trend:\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. **Early period (1449-1550)**: Female speakers comprise 20-40% of characters, with notable variations (e.g., 57% in Fabula de Cefalo e Procris, 1475; but 0% in several religious plays)\n\n2. **Renaissance peak (1550-1650)**: Shows higher female representation, often 25-50%, particularly in comedies and pastorals\n\n3. **Baroque period (1650-1750)**: Maintains consistent 20-35% female representation, with opera librettos (Metastasio) typically featuring 25-30%\n\n4. **Neoclassical decline (1750-1850)**: Notable decrease in female roles, particularly in tragedies (Alfieri's works often have only 10-25% female speakers)\n\n**Overall trend**: ItaDraCor shows a **gradual decline** in female speaker percentage from Renaissance highs to neoclassical lows, with the most dramatic drop occurring in the late 18th/early 19th centuries when heroic tragedies dominated, emphasizing male political and military themes.\n\nThe corpus demonstrates how dramatic conventions and cultural attitudes toward women's public roles directly influenced character gender distribution over time.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "ita"}, "id": "mcptoolu_011c48mHF3vJnEvgUCziZT7W", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 77586, "output_tokens": 424}, "id": "4-4", "run": 18, "datetime": "2025-11-24T17:23:06.705302", "tool_path_length_difference": 0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0}
