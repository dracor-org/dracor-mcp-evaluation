{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Now let me analyze the gender distribution over time. I'll extract the key information about female and male speakers across different time periods.\n\nBased on the Swedish drama corpus metadata, here's the **gender distribution change over time**:\n\n**1880s**: Female characters comprise **20-30%** of speakers on average (e.g., Strindberg's early works show 3-6 female vs 12-15 male characters)\n\n**1883-1885**: Peak period for **female representation** - several plays have **50-70%** female characters (Leffler's works: \"Elfvan\" 10F/3M, \"Moster Malvina\" 8F/0M)\n\n**1886-1890**: More **balanced representation** - around **40-50%** female characters in many works\n\n**1890s-1900**: **Declining female representation** - returns to **30-40%** female characters, with some plays having very few female roles\n\n**Key trend**: Swedish drama shows a **temporary surge in female character prominence in the mid-1880s**, particularly in works by female playwrights like Anne Charlotte Leffler, followed by a **gradual decline** toward more male-dominated casts by the turn of the century.\n\nThe most female-dominated plays are from the 1880s-1890s, while earlier and later periods show more traditional male-heavy distributions.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_012N4diPicpqrFCWVgvhNXh5", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 43646, "output_tokens": 399}, "id": "4-3", "run": 12, "datetime": "2025-11-24T16:38:14.160832", "tool_path_length_difference": 0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0, "tool_error_rate": {"overall_error_rate": 0.0, "insertions": [], "deletions": [], "substitutions": []}}
