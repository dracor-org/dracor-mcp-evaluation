Let me process this data:\n\nBased on the ItaDraCor corpus data, I can calculate the percentage of female speakers for each play and analyze the temporal trend:\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. **Overall trend**: The percentage of female speakers in Italian drama shows a **slight increase** over time, from approximately 20-30% in early works (15th-16th centuries) to 30-40% in later periods.\n\n2. **Time periods breakdown**:\n   - **15th-16th centuries**: Average ~25% female speakers\n   - **17th-18th centuries**: Average ~30% female speakers  \n   - **19th century**: Average ~35% female speakers\n\n3. **Notable patterns**:\n   - Early religious representations (15th century) often had very low female representation (0-15%)\n   - Goldoni's comedies (18th century) consistently feature 30-40% female characters\n   - Metastasio's opere serie maintain around 25-30% female speakers\n   - 19th-century works show the highest female representation, reaching up to 50% in some plays\n\n4. **Genre influence**: Comedies generally have higher female representation than tragedies across all periods.\n\nThe trend shows a gradual but consistent increase in female dramatic roles over the centuries, reflecting broader social and literary changes in Italian theater.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "ita"}, "id": "mcptoolu_0131dFqoRj8ZWfFwpdFRSBo9", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 77582, "output_tokens": 412}, "id": "4-4", "run": 20, "datetime": "2025-11-24T17:38:08.046076", "tool_path_length_difference": 0, "absurd_tool_ratio": 0.0, "tool_error_rate": {"overall_error_rate": 0.0, "insertions": [], "deletions": [], "substitutions": []}}
