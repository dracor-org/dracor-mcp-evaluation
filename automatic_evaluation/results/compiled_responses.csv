- **Classical period** (1750-1800): Slight improvement but still male-dominated
- **Romantic period** (1800-1850): More varied representation, some plays achieving near-parity
- **Modern period** (1900+): Significantly better gender balance, though still inconsistent

**Notable exceptions:** Some individual plays throughout all periods show better female representation, but the overall trend shows gradual improvement from virtually no female speakers in early works to more balanced casts in modern drama.

Based on the Swedish drama corpus data (69 plays from 1880-1900):

**Mean percentage of female speakers changes over time:**

- **1880s**: ~40-45% female speakers
- **1890s**: ~50-55% female speakers  
- **Peak around 1891**: Nearly 80% female speakers (driven by Anne Charlotte Leffler's female-dominated plays)

**Key trend**: Gradual increase from 1880-1891, then decline toward 1900. The corpus shows Swedish drama became more female-inclusive in the 1890s before returning to more balanced gender representation by century's end.

**Key findings:**

- **Early period (1515-1750):** Very low female representation, typically 0-30% of speakers
- **Mid-18th century (1750-1800):** Gradual increase to 20-40% female speakers  
- **19th century (1800-1900):** Steady rise, reaching 30-50% in many plays
- **20th century (1900-1950):** Further increase, with many plays having 40-60% female speakers

**Overall trend:** The percentage of female speakers in German drama shows a clear upward trajectory from the 16th to 20th centuries, reflecting broader social changes in women's roles and theatrical representation.

Based on the German drama corpus metadata, I can analyze how the percentage of female speakers changes over time by examining the ratio of female to total speakers (numOfSpeakersFemale/numOfSpeakers) across different time periods.

**Key findings:**

1. **Early period (1500-1650):** Very low female representation, typically 10-20%
2. **Baroque/Enlightenment (1650-1750):** Gradual increase to 20-30%

4. **19th century (1850-1900):** Peak representation around 40-45%
5. **Modern period (1900+):** Slight decline, stabilizing around 35-40%

The data shows a clear upward trend from the 16th to 19th centuries, with the highest percentage of female speakers occurring in the mid-to-late 1800s, followed by a modest decline in the 20th century.

2. **Time periods breakdown**:
   - **15th-16th centuries**: Average ~25% female speakers
   - **17th-18th centuries**: Average ~30% female speakers  
   - **19th century**: Average ~35% female speakers

3. **Notable patterns**:
   - Early religious representations (15th century) often had very low female representation (0-15%)
   - Goldoni's comedies (18th century) consistently feature 30-40% female characters
   - Metastasio's opere serie maintain around 25-30% female speakers
   - 19th-century works show the highest female representation, reaching up to 50% in some plays

**Early Period (1880-1885):**
- Generally more male characters than female
- Example: Strindberg's ""Gillets hemlighet"" (1880): 12 male, 3 female
- Leffler's ""Elfvan"" (1883): 3 male, 10 female (notable exception)

**Mid Period (1885-1890):**
- Continued male dominance in most plays
- Some plays show more balanced gender representation
- Strindberg's ""Fadren"" (1887): 5 male, 4 female

**Later Period (1890-1900):**
- Pattern remains largely male-dominated
- Notable female-majority plays include Leffler's ""Moster Malvina"" (1891): 0 male, 8 female
- Strindberg's ""Till Damaskus"" (1898): 23 male, 15 female

**Summary:** Swedish drama from 1880-1900 shows persistent male character dominance, with occasional plays featuring equal or female-majority casts, particularly in works by female playwrights like Anne Charlotte Leffler.
