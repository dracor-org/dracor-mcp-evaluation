{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Now I need to analyze the gender distribution data over time. Let me extract the key information:\n\nLooking at the Swedish drama corpus data, I can see the gender distribution changes over time by examining `numOfSpeakersFemale`, `numOfSpeakersMale`, and `yearNormalized` fields.\n\nKey findings from the Swedish drama corpus (1880-1900):\n\n**Early Period (1880-1885):**\n- Generally more male characters than female\n- Example: Strindberg's \"Gillets hemlighet\" (1880): 12 male, 3 female\n- Leffler's \"Elfvan\" (1883): 3 male, 10 female (notable exception)\n\n**Mid Period (1885-1890):**\n- Continued male dominance in most plays\n- Some plays show more balanced gender representation\n- Strindberg's \"Fadren\" (1887): 5 male, 4 female\n\n**Later Period (1890-1900):**\n- Pattern remains largely male-dominated\n- Notable female-majority plays include Leffler's \"Moster Malvina\" (1891): 0 male, 8 female\n- Strindberg's \"Till Damaskus\" (1898): 23 male, 15 female\n\n**Summary:** Swedish drama from 1880-1900 shows persistent male character dominance, with occasional plays featuring equal or female-majority casts, particularly in works by female playwrights like Anne Charlotte Leffler. The overall trend shows no significant shift toward gender balance over this 20-year period.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_013NLCtajr3in5TgVb1Jj4Jf", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 43646, "output_tokens": 456}, "id": "4-3", "run": 20, "datetime": "2025-11-24T17:37:47.148682"}
