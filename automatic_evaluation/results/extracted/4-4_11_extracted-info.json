{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Now I need to analyze this data to understand how the percentage of female speakers changes over time. Let me extract the key information and calculate percentages for each play, then analyze the temporal trends.\n\nBased on the ItaDraCor metadata, I can analyze how the percentage of female speakers changes over time:\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. **Early period (1465-1600)**: Female speaker percentage varies widely, from 0% to 66.7%, with many plays having around 20-40% female speakers.\n\n2. **17th century (1600-1700)**: Generally maintains 15-40% female speakers, with some notable exceptions like religious representations having fewer female roles.\n\n3. **18th century (1700-1800)**: Shows more consistency, typically 20-35% female speakers, particularly in Goldoni's comedies and Metastasio's operas which often feature 2-3 female roles out of 6-10 total characters.\n\n4. **19th century (1800+)**: Limited data shows around 10-25% female speakers in the few available works.\n\n**Overall trend**: The percentage of female speakers in ItaDraCor remains relatively stable across centuries, typically ranging from 20-40%, with no clear linear increase or decrease over time. The variation appears more dependent on genre and individual playwright preferences than historical period.\n\nThe data suggests Italian drama maintained a fairly consistent representation of female speaking roles throughout its history, unlike some other European traditions that showed more dramatic changes over time.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "ita"}, "id": "mcptoolu_01J4Dsrtz9hsMdNy4qvLiE7z", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 77588, "output_tokens": 430}, "id": "4-4", "run": 11, "datetime": "2025-11-24T16:31:22.881767"}
