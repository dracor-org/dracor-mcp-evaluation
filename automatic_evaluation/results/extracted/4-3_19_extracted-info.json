Most plays have 2-3 times more male speakers than female.\n\n**Key observations**:\n- Early period (1880-1890): Average ~65% male characters\n- Authors like Strindberg consistently feature more male characters\n- Female authors (Leffler, Agrell) show more balanced gender representation\n- Late 1890s: Slight improvement toward more female characters\n\n**Overall trend**: Swedish drama shows persistent male dominance throughout the period, with only gradual improvement. Female representation rarely exceeds 40-45% of speaking characters, even in works by female playwrights.\n\nThe data reveals **limited progress** in gender balance, with most plays maintaining traditional male-heavy character distributions regardless of time period.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_01QcK2oYbZXjsYGenZXYEb3M", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 43646, "output_tokens": 309}, "id": "4-3", "run": 19, "datetime": "2025-11-24T17:30:32.330919"}
