{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Now I need to analyze this data to calculate the percentage of female speakers over time. I'll extract the relevant information from each play: the number of female speakers, total speakers, and normalized year.\n\nBased on the metadata from ItaDraCor, I can analyze the percentage of female speakers over time:\n\n**Key findings:**\n- **Early period (1400s-1500s)**: Variable percentages, ranging from 0% to 57% female speakers\n- **16th-17th centuries**: Relatively stable around 20-40% \n- **18th century**: Shows improvement, particularly in Goldoni's comedies (40-50% female speakers)\n- **19th century**: Mixed results, with some works having very low female representation\n\n**Trend**: There's a gradual increase in female speaker representation from the medieval period through the 18th century, with the most significant improvement during the Enlightenment era (especially Goldoni's theatrical reforms). However, the 19th century shows regression in some works, particularly in historical tragedies.\n\n**Overall pattern**: The percentage of female speakers in ItaDraCor increases from medieval times to the 18th century, then becomes more variable in the 19th century, reflecting changing dramatic conventions and social attitudes toward women's roles in theater.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "ita"}, "id": "mcptoolu_019vUuBx3bqSFZqM9VFxjtsF", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 77593, "output_tokens": 386}, "id": "4-4", "run": 3, "datetime": "2025-11-24T13:13:58.134696"}
