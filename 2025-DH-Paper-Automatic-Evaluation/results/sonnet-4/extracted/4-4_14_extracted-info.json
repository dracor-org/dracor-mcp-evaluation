{"success": true, "valid": null, "response": "Now I need to analyze this data to calculate the percentage of female speakers over time. Let me extract the relevant information and organize it by normalized year.\n\nBased on the metadata from ItaDraCor, I can analyze the percentage of female speakers over time:\n\n**Early Period (1400s-1500s):** \n- Very low female representation, typically 0-40%\n- Many religious plays had minimal female roles\n\n**Renaissance (1500s-1600s):**\n- Gradual increase to 20-50% female speakers\n- Comedy genre shows higher female participation than tragedy\n\n**17th-18th Century:**\n- Peak period with 30-60% female speakers\n- Opera libretti (Metastasio) maintain consistent ~30% female representation\n- Goldoni's comedies achieve nearly balanced gender representation (40-50%)\n\n**Modern Period (1800s-1900s):**\n- Decline to 10-30% female speakers\n- Romantic tragedies favor male-dominated casts\n\n**Key Trend:** Female speaker percentage in ItaDraCor increases from the medieval period through the 17th-18th centuries (peaking around 1750), then declines in the modern period. The highest female representation occurs in comedies of the 1700s, particularly Goldoni's works.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata", "input": {"corpus_name": "ita"}, "id": "mcptoolu_0197xqjRZUAxQr9JbxFNZ1mH", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 77587, "output_tokens": 390}, "id": "4-4", "run": 14, "datetime": "2025-11-24T16:54:07.818255"}
