The change is incremental rather than revolutionary, with individual authors like Leffler showing more gender-balanced casts earlier than others.", "tools_used": [{"name": "get_corpus_metadata_csv", "input": {"corpus_name": "swe"}, "id": "mcptoolu_0179K9h8DrmJraAuUBgiyyg1", "is_error": false}], "tool_chain": ["get_corpus_metadata_csv"], "usage_infos": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 29288, "output_tokens": 334}, "id": "4-3", "run": 16, "datetime": "2025-11-24T17:08:55.510191"}
